# Team3-Emoji-Translator

This is Programming 2 Team 3's repository for our group emoji translator java project. This repository hosts all the code for our program
as well as including a folder that contains photos of examples and tests for our program, alongside another folder that contains legacy
classes not used for the main program.

Our progamming team consists of 4 main contributors, these being Blane Hulak, Ellie Earwood, Brayden Bond, and Sam Schaefer.

The workload for the project is split up into 4 classes made by seperate group members. The shared workload is below.

EmojiManager.java - Ellie Earwood

InputHandler.java - Blane Hulak

Translator.java and GUI.java - Sam Schaefer

(Intially GUI.java was going to be Brayden's class, but after no communication, Sam created the class in his stead)
